## Why choose Shocket?
I have no idea.

## What is Shocket?
Shocket is a networking library written by [@JeppeSRC](https://github.com/JeppeSRC) and [@raresica1234](https://github.com/raresica1234) in a collaboration.

## Why did we create Shocket?
The need for a C++ networking library was big for us, we both have engines and we decided, since we both need it, why not create it in a collaboration.
